Mappila Bay </font></h1></center></h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;"> Boating within the bay area is pleasant. However, if you are venturing away from the bay to inner sea, make sure the weather conditions will stay favorable. The placid coastal waters of the region can suddenly turn violent if weather conditions deteriorate. 
In its great past, Mopila bay served as a port. For several centuries it linked Malabar to foreign countries. .</p> <br>
